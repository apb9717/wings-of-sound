# Wings of Sounds API
The key entity we chose for our API is Venue since Venue data will be the most essential component for our analysis. The attributes include: <br /> 

id = string (unique identifier)<br />
name = string <br /> 
city = string<br />
zipcode = integer<br />
phone = integer<br />
capacity = integer<br />
style = list of strings (e.g. ["Theater","Performance Space"])<br />
keywords = list of strings (e.g. ["Intimate","Classy","Modern"])

The main advantage for building an API for our project is efficient data management. Having an API not only adds flexibility with functions to modify and remove data, but also allows reusability of the data. Additionally, it also provides a centralized access to Venue data and facilitates collaboration.
